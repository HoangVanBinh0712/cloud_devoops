# Cloud DevOps

## Overview

This repository contains my portfolio showcasing the skills and knowledge I gained during the Cloud DevOps Nanodegree program at Udacity. Through this program, I have developed expertise in building and managing cloud-based infrastructure using various tools and technologies.

## Skills Learned

- **Building Static Websites using AWS S3 and CloudFront:** I have learned how to leverage AWS services like S3 for hosting static websites and CloudFront for content delivery and scalability.

- **Building a Server System with Load Balancing and Auto Scaling with cloudFormation:** Through hands-on projects, I have mastered the setup and configuration of server systems with load balancing and auto-scaling capabilities to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

- **Utilizing Kubernetes for System Deployment:** Kubernetes has been an integral part of my learning journey. I am proficient in deploying and managing containerized applications using Kubernetes, enabling efficient orchestration and scaling of services.

- **Implementing Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** I have gained experience in setting up CI/CD pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment processes, facilitating rapid and reliable software delivery.

## Technologies & Tools
- **AWS (Amazon Web Services):** serves as the backbone for hosting and managing cloud-based infrastructure, providing a wide range of services for computing, storage, networking, and more.

- **Docker:** Docker has been instrumental in containerizing applications and streamlining development and deployment workflows.

- **Kubernetes:** Kubernetes has empowered me to efficiently manage containerized workloads at scale, enabling seamless deployment, scaling, and management of applications.

## Projects

- **Project 1: Building a Scalable Static Website:** Demonstrated proficiency in deploying a static website using AWS S3 and CloudFront, ensuring high availability and low latency for users.

- **Project 2: Implementing Load Balancing and Auto Scaling:** Successfully set up a server system with load balancing and auto-scaling capabilities to handle varying traffic loads and ensure optimal performance.

- **Project 3: Kubernetes Deployment:** Developed and deployed containerized applications using Kubernetes, showcasing the ability to manage complex application environments efficiently.

- **Project 4: CI/CD Pipeline Setup:** Implemented CI/CD pipelines to automate the software delivery process, enabling rapid and reliable deployment of applications.
